            "Realizing that there are lots of different temporality formats is
            basically what ecological awareness is. It's equivalent to
            acknowledging in a deep way the existence of beings that aren't you,
            with whom you coexist. Once you've done that, you can't
            un-acknowledge it. There's no going back." â€• Timothy Morton we turn

            perversely use Darwin to our advantage evolution has always meant
            branched becoming life comes from life all creatures and non-beings
            and things and entities and organisms and phenomena and and and- we
            are in coexistence nothing exists without another and nothing comes
            from nothing what theorists write about we feel in our bile in our
